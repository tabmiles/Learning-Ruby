The language Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto and released to the public in 1995. It was created to “form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.” (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/)

I plan on using sites such as tutorialspoint.com and freecodecamp.org to learn Ruby.
Here is a list of resources I may use:
- freecodecamp.org
- tutorialspoint.com
- scotch.io
- rubyGuides.com
