# This file goes over the installation and running of Ruby code. Please see dataTypes.rb for code about data types.

# Installation
First, download Virtual Studio Code (VSCode) by going to https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and downloading for your OS (I used Windows).
Next, in VSCode go to "extentions" or hit CTRL + Shift + X. Search “ruby” by Peng Lv and download it. Next, in extentions search "code runner" by Jun Han and download it. This will let you write and run code within VSCode.

# First Ruby Program: Hello World
Now, make a new file from the top left-hand corner in VSCode. You should hit "file" and select "new file" from the dropdown menu -- or use CTRL + N.
Write your code and save as ruby file (.rb). I started with the following Ruby code to print "Hello World":
```
 puts "Hello World"
```
Finally, to run the file, click the play button in the top right-hand corner. When it runs, a small window (1/4 of the screen) will pop up in the lower section of the screen, displaying "Hello World". That lower part of the screen should also have sections such as "Debug Console" and "Terminal" -- which is where you will see anything that is printed.
