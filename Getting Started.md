##First, download Atom.io by going to https://atom.io/ and downloading for your OS (I used Windows).
##Next, in Atom hit CTRL + , to get to settings and hit “Install Packages.” Search “atom runner” by lsegal (or possibly |sega|) and download it.
##Now, make a new file from the top left-hand corner in Atom. You should hit "file" and select "new file" from the dropdown menu -- or use CTRL + N.
##Write your code and save as ruby file (.rb). I started with the following Ruby code to print "Hello World":

puts "Hello World"

##Finally, to run the file, use ALT + R (CTRL + R for Mac). When it runs, a small window (1/4 of the screen) will pop up in the lower section of the screen, displaying "Hello World".
