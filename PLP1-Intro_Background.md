# Ruby
Ruby is an object oriented language with significant flexibility.
# History
The language Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto and released to the public in 1995. It was created to “form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.” (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/)
